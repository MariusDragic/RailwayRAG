It is necessary to detect the presence of other vehicles, pedestrians and other relevant\nentities. Safety concerns and the need for accurate estimations have led to the introduction of Light\nDetection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems in complement to camera or radar based perception systems.\nThis article presents a review of state-of-the-art automotive LiDAR technologies and the perception\nalgorithms used with those technologies. LiDAR systems are introduced ﬁrst by analyzing the main\ncomponents, from laser transmitter to its beam scanning mechanism. Advantages/disadvantages and the\ncurrent status of various solutions are introduced and compared.

Sensors initially capture data representation of the environment that are processed by perception\nalgorithms to build the vehicle’s immediate environment used for autonomous vehicle navigation. A\nperception system for autonomous vehicle navigation would consist of a combination of active and\npassive sensors, namely, cameras, radars, and LiDARs (Light detection and ranging) [1]. LiDARs are\nactive sensors that illuminate the surroundings by emitting lasers. Ranges are measured precisely by\nprocessing the received laser returns from the reﬂecting surfaces.

Then, tracks are estimated through ﬁnding best associations of detections, which is\nachieved by a marching net and scoring net.\nApart from improving the tradition perception components, point-wise semantic segmentation, which\nwas hard to be realized before, is now achievable by deep learning. A well-known method PointNet was\n7http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval object.php?obj benchmark=bev",

SqueezeSeg\n[53] achieved real-time segmentation by applying CNN in range view of LiDAR points. Due to a lack of\nmassive annotated datasets, the performances of these two methods are not ready for deployment in real\nusage.

In summary, current automotive LiDARs face the constraints, or\nchallenges as: 1) cost, 2) meet automotive reliability and safety standards (e.g. ISO26262, IEC61508), 3)\nlong measuring distance (e.g. >200m for highway applications), 4) adverse weather i.e. rain, fog, snow\netc, 5) image-level resolution, 6) smaller size facilitating integration. At present, all the possible solutions\nvarying from laser sources (905nm V .S. 1550nm), scanning methods (Spinning/MEMS/OPA/Flash) or\nranging principles (ToF or FMCW), are exploited to overcome several or all of these difﬁculties. It\nis really hard to predict which automotive LiDAR solution(s) will dominate the future, whereas one\nthing is sure: automotive LiDARs are walking out of experimental platforms, entering more and more\nmass-produced cars.\nThen, a compact tutorial of the LiDAR based perception systems for autonomous driving is presented.\nThree levels of information providing by perception systems, along with typical processing pipeline are\n8http://www.semantic-kitti.org/",

This\nis caused by the LiDAR’s poor resolution and its essence as a distance measuring sensor, not contextual\nsensor. Fusion with cameras remedies LiDAR’s weakness in recognition.

Typically, the concepts and level of detail are\ndetermined by the envisioned use case of the ontology. For example, OTN, a\ngeneral ontology of transportation networks, contains some railway concepts at a\nlevel of detail suﬃcient to describe transportation between railway stations [16].\nOTN is also an example of a reusable ontology, as it has been included in the\nsmart-city ontology km4city [3]. Daniele and Pires [9] describe an ontological\napproach to logistics. Katsumi and Fox [14] survey ontologies for transportation\nresearch. Although ontologies for transportation research often also contain\nrailway concepts, they lack the necessary detail to describe the topology of a\nrailway network at the operating level (e.g., switches, tracks, signals).",

Either diﬀerent subsystems of the railway system have a slightly\ndiﬀerent view of the overall system, or there exist country- and vendor-speciﬁc\nviews of the same subsystem. For historic reasons, railway signalling is very\ncountry-speciﬁc, especially in the European Union. Therefore, many ontologies\nfor integrating railway data have been developed by EU-funded research projects\nand during European initiatives like SHIFT2Rail2 and its predecessors.

To achieve this, we diagnose and lift the key\nefficiency bottlenecks in the view transformation with optimized\nBEV pooling, reducing latency by more than 40 ×.

Following LSS [ 6], we explicitly predict the\ndiscrete depth distribution of each pixel. We then scatter each\nfeature pixel into D discrete points along the camera ray and\nrescale the associated features by their corresponding depth\nprobabilities (Figure 3a).

Introduction\nRailways have been one of the main commodities to\nmove passengers and freight since at least the late 19th\ncentury. Nevertheless, operators have faced mounting pres-\nsure to meet ever-increasing performance and safety de-\nmands from the public [1]. On top of such targets, the\nawareness of cybersecurity themes has also changed. For\nthese reasons, securing railway systems from cyber attacks\nhas lately become a central issue for practitioners and the\npublic, especially after recent news stories such as [2].\nThe cause for this abrupt need for answers is simple:\nwhile, in the past, railway systems often depended on\nspeciﬁcally purposed electromechanical devices that oper-\nated in an air-gapped environment, newer infrastructures\nare often based on commercial-oﬀ-the-shelf systems that\noperate in a fully networked setting.

This means that such\nnew installations oﬀer both a much larger attack surface\nand that attacks can be carried out with shallower knowl-\nedge than before. The reliance on shared infrastructures\nfor the operations of multiple subsystems (e.g., both VOIP\nand signaling might use the same network infrastructure\nto carry information) ampliﬁes this problem, making the\npossibility of lateral movements extremely relevant. This\npossibility is problematic because railway companies may\noperate (through the same shared infrastructure) Infor-\nmation and Communication Technology (ICT) services,\nwhich have also been hit by various attacks [3]. This\nscenario is not unique to the railway sector: many public\ninfrastructures have become victims of cyber attacks in\nrecent years.\nMany proposals have arisen to address this issue.

Railways as an integrated system\nIn a broad sense, railways can be deﬁned as a collection\nof diﬀerent systems whose purpose is to transfer passengers\nand goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails located\non tracks. Such subsystems can be broadly collected into\nthree families:\n• Railway infrastructure comprises all the tracks\n(sometimes referred to as the permanent way ), all\nthe civil works, and the systems and premises that\nensure the regular traﬃc ﬂow.

This suggests that\n“holistic” approaches that favor securing the system as a\nwhole [8] should be preferred to approaches that focus on\nsecuring a single component of the system without caring\nfor its overall capability to accomplish its many tasks.\nA. The dualism between safety and security\nSafety is deeply ingrained into modern industry, and\nrailway makes no exception.

Future challenges and conclusions\nIn this survey, we have reviewed the current landscape\nregarding the cybersecurity of railway systems, with a\nspecial focus on signaling systems and noting how they\nstrongly rely on complex communication networks.\nTo do so, we ﬁrst analyzed the origin of the ever-\nincreasing interest in new tools and methodologies for\ncybersecurity rapid risk assessment for safety-critical in-\nfrastructure and reviewed the guidelines that can be ap-\nplied to rail signaling scenarios. We then proposed a novel\ncybersecurity assessment procedure and showed how one\ncan heavily exploit cyber ranges as an enabling technology\nto create virtual scenarios in which each vulnerability can\nbe tested and its impact/risk assessed. As a result, our\nassessment procedure can help improve the cybersecurity\nposture of railway systems by understanding and mitigat-\ning cyber threats and vulnerabilities.\nMany questions remain open. The most pressing one\nis how to better integrate cyber ranges with digital twins.\nThis would allow for an unprecedented level of ﬁdelity and",

Among the former, we can further distinguish\nbased on the distance traveled and the kind of territory\nserved (e.g., urban, inter-regional, etc.) Railway networks\nare often organized around mainline rails that serve as a\nroute between major urban centers and to which branches,\nyards, sidings, and spurs are connected. Mainline is used\nto provide both High-Speed Rail 8 (HSR) services and\nconventional speed rail services. Regional traﬃc may or\nmay not share the infrastructure with mainline traﬃc [116]\nand provides conventional medium/short-based services.\n8An HSR service is deﬁned as a service that achieves a speed [114]\nof at least 200 km/h, regardless of the distance covered [115].",

Examples of such traﬃc are metros,\ntramways, and light rails.\nAppendix B\nIncidents and their modeling\nMany authors have formally proposed approaches to\nanalyze such cyber attacks to understand better the attack\npatterns used. We cite here attack graphs [117], trees [118],\n[119], vectors [120], surfaces [121], over and above diamond\nmodel [122], OWASP threat model [123], and the so-called\n“kill chain” approach.

More recently,\nLocked Martin introduced the same concept in the cyber\ndomain context [130] to better model attacks involving\nnetwork intrusions. It involves seven phases, each of which\nhas a preferred mitigation approach.\nAccording to the kill chain approach to modeling\nthreats [131], cyber reconnaissance is the ﬁrst step an\nattacker performs when trying to breach a system. There\nare two types of reconnaissance: passive and active. Pas-\nsive reconnaissance is when the attacker gathers infor-\nmation about a target without direct interaction. Active\nreconnaissance is when an attacker directly interfaces with\na target system to gather speciﬁc details that are later\nhelpful in delivering a malicious payload. The subsequent\nphases are [132]: weaponization, in which the intruder\ncreates remote access malware “weapons” tailored to one\nor more vulnerabilities; delivery of the weapon to the\ntarget; exploitation, which happens when the “weapon” is\ntriggered; installation, which refers to the phase in which\nthe weapon installs backdoors of various kind; command",

There are several reasons why investment in railway infrastructure\n(mainly construction but also maintenance) could increase in the near future. For example,\nthe European Union has established a new action plan to boost long-distance and cross-border\npassenger rail to foster sustainable mobility (European Commission, 2021). Furthermore, the\ntrend towards intermodal and multi-modal mobility requires corresponding facilities such as\ntransport hubs and IT systems such as digital platforms (Montero and Finger, 2020).\nPublic transportation in general and railways in particular exhibit a great extent of scale\neconomies. This renders railway infrastructure a natural monopoly (Crozet, Nash, and Preston,\n2012). Usually, infrastructure is owned and managed by a state-owned infrastructure company\nor a separate infrastructure division of a state-owned transport company (Finger, 2014). The",

In the\nwake of liberalization of the public sector in general and of the railway sector in particular, many\ninfrastructure companies were compelled to start procuring construction and maintenance using\ncompetitive procurement procedures such as auctions (Laﬀont and Tirole, 1993).\nThis is supposed to ensure eﬃcient use of (partially) public money. However, as common to\nprocurement auctions, concerns regarding bid-rigging appear (Lengwiler and Wolfstetter, 2006).\nTherefore, and because of the large amount of public money involved, infrastructure companies\nand their regulators have a vital interest in preventing unlawful cooperation of ﬁrms applying for\nprojects.

These so-\ncalled screening methods constitute the ﬁrst step of a multi-phase process that ﬁnally may\ncondemn illegally cooperating ﬁrms. From an empirical perspective, screening methods are\napplied in the presence of ”prediction policy problems” (Kleinberg, Ludwig, Mullainathan, and\nObermeyer, 2015). That is, researchers aim to predict the probability of a cartel. As we use\nbidding patterns in procurement auctions to identify potential cartels, we focus on price screens\nin this review section. Moreover, our main attention is on behavioral screens, observing ﬁrms’\nbehavior in markets. This is opposed to structural screens, which identify markets with typical\ncartel-conducive traits such as a small number of bidders (Harrington, 2008). Note that the\nGerman Railways use structural screens to identify markets prone to cartels (see, e.g., Beth and\nGannon, 2022).\nAs we show in Section 4, we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcient of variation, deﬁned as the standard de-",

The region of interest (ROI) for\nobject detection includes the tracks as well as the 3D tubular\nspace formed by the predicted train’s driveway and minimum\nclearance profile. To determine the ROI, the datasets must\ninclude tracks and other rail infrastructure objects such as\nswitches and transitions, which allow the prediction of the\ntrain’s driveway.\nThird, compared to road vehicles, braking distances of\nrail vehicles are about five times larger, and whistling and\nemergency braking are the only available reactions to ob-\nstacles, since evasion is obviously not an option.

As a\nreference, Tab. II presents median distances for human train\ndriver’s performance in detecting objects, which might serve\nas a benchmark in safety argumentation [8].

AI Inferencing Engine \nAt the core of the system is the AI inferencing engine, which \nprocesses all user inputs and requests for defect generation. It \noperates in the following steps: \n1) Step-1(Synthetic Dataset Generation): We leverage \nthe capabilities of GPT -4 to generate a synthetic dataset \nconsisting of image -caption pairs. The proposed dataset \ngeneration pipeline processes an input image and uses a \nprompt template designed to make GPT -4 capture the \nvisual characteristics of defect textures. These visual \ncomponents are selected based on existing literature on \nrailway defect inspection and texture generation [9]. The \ngenerated captions are then passed to Algorithm 1 ,",

It\nlearns a spatial world model in the BEV embedding space\nwithout any labeled data by learning. It does not require\nthe manual creation of positive/negative pairs for contrastive\nlearning, nor does it need to explicitly reconstruct the com-\nplex, high-uncertainty driving scenes. Extensive experiments\nshow that AD-L-JEPA is a more efficient pre-training method\ncompared to SOTA and learns faster better data representa-\ntions that are useful for downstream task generalization.

This relates\nback to the inherent difficulty in specifying railway safety\nrequirements, as participant #8 said when asked the question,\n”How would you define railway safety?”\n”It’s complicated and I’ll leave it at that. ”\nHowever, we do not intend to leave it at that. Relating\nthese findings back to our surrounding work and the SACRED\nmethodology, we believe it is possible to ’de-mystify’ safety.\nSACRED’s strength lies in its input-agnostic nature. Instead of\nclassifying relationships between systems, SACRED focuses\non generating safety metrics specific to a given domain through\nthe usage of the Operational Domain Model (ODM), as op-\nposed to the current industry standard of using an Operational\nDesign Domain (ODD).\nThe insights from this study emphasize the necessity of\ndeveloping safety metrics tailored to the unique aspects of the\nrailway ecosystem, rather than relying solely on pre-existing",

Our model\nborrows some components from TSTGCN [5], but modifies\nthe components/features to make them more suitable for the\nIndian Railway network. We start by describing the station-\nspecific features that we propose to incorporate in our model.\nA. Station-specific features\nAs our primary task is to predict station-specific average\narrival delay, we propose to maintain the following two features\nper station, namely, (1) hourly average arrival delay, and\n(2) hourly average departure delay. Note that earlier approaches\nemployed two different station-level features – the number of\narrival and departure delays of trains per hour [5]. As our\nprediction problem has shifted from predicting the number\nof delayed trains per station to predicting the average delay\nprediction per station, we have modified these features as stated\nabove. We further argue that not only the average delays, but\ntotal hourly arrival and departure delays at each station also\nplay important role in the delay modeling. So, for each station,\nwe also maintain total hourly arrival and departure delays.\nMoreover, we propose to employa novel station-specific",

Hourly headway is defined as\nthe average difference between consecutive trains according\nto the actual schedules for a given hour at a specific station.\nPrior studies have shown that train delays can be affected\nby headway [11]. Our hypothesis is that short headways,\nindicating more frequent trains, hinder the recovery of delays\nfor subsequent incoming trains. In contrast, longer headways\nprovide greater buffer time, enabling better delay mitigation.\nB. Model details\nOur framework is composed of three distinct modules to\nprocess the recent, daily, and weekly history, respectively. Each\nmodule consists of multiple spatio-temporal encoder blocks,\nwhere each block consists of an attention block, followed\nby a convolution block, and finally concluded by a fully\nconnected layer, as shown in Fig 1. The outputs of these\nthree modules are linearly combined to obtain the final output.\nNow, we describe the framework in detail, highlighting our\nmodel-specific contributions.\nFig. 1: RSTGCN Model Architechture",

Key contributions include a novel feature-\nrich architecture, the integration of train frequency in spatial\nmodeling, and the creation of a comprehensive dataset for the\nIndian Railway Network. Our model consistently outperforms\nexisting baselines, especially in dense and high-traffic zones\nwhere delay propagation is significant. These results hold\nimportant implications for Indian Railways, enabling more\naccurate scheduling and resource planning. From a policy\nperspective, our framework offers a scalable, data-driven\nsolution for identifying bottlenecks and guiding operational\nimprovements. The nationwide temporal railway delay dataset\nprovides a strong foundation for future research and practical\ndeployment to improve punctuality and passenger experience.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. Li, X.

The propagation mechanisms con -\nsidered in the simulations are line of sight (LOS), scatter -\ning (multiple scattering theory for vegetation and single \nlobe directive model for others), diffraction (Uniform The -\nory of Diffraction), and reflection.\nWe define two antenna setups: both the transmitter \n(Tx) and the receiver (Rx) in the setup 1 (6 m and 4.5 m) \nare higher than those in the setup 2 (1 m and 0.92 m).

Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this article, we identify the main challenges and pres -\nent a series of work including railway scenario modeling, \nray-tracing simulations, and channel modeling, towards \n realistic 5G channel models for railway use cases at \nmmWave band. We have seen that including railway fea -\ntures in channel models is a challenging task mostly be -\ncause there are no channel models focused exclusively on \nrailways. A possible solution for this is to use the standard \nrailway scenarios for the ray tracer. Regarding this tool, \nwe have shown the fundamental characteristics of the",

To effectively defend\nagainst adversaries, it is required to not only test autonomous\ncars for ﬁnding driving errors but to improve the robustness of\nthe cars to these errors.

Our methodology supports testing autonomous cars in a\nmulti-agent environment, where we train and compare adversar-\nial car policy on two custom reward functions to test the driving\ncontrol decision of autonomous cars.

This indicates that the quality of the\nsolution is not solely dependent on the number of scheduled\ntrains, but also on other factors such as minimizing schedule\nchanges. This happens because, in order to schedule a\nhigher number of services, it is often required to make\nmore significant changes to the requested times, thereby\nincurring higher penalties.

Smaller deviations in these\nmetrics, as achieved by GA, result in fewer penalties due\nto schedule changes, making such solutions more favorable\nin contexts where adherence to initial schedules is critical.\nHowever, it is worth noting that larger deviations can",

This scenario has the characteristics of high road loss, high penetration loss, relatively slow\nangle change, and overall shift of Doppler frequency in one direction. Therefore, beamforming is\nneeded to enhance the signal to overcome the path loss.

For this reason, the results obtained from the\nsynthetic data are compared with a sequence of the KITTI dataset [15] gathered from\na highway as depicted in Figure 4.a, namely “KITTI 01”, which better matches a\nrailway scenario.

A large number of grade crossings exist without \nany gate. There is an inherent unreliability in the present \nmanual system.

Because the frequency in the railway grid diﬀers from the one in\nthe public power grid, conversion of frequency is needed. This conversion can either be done by using\na Rotary Frequency Converter (RFC) or a Static Frequency Converter (SFC) [2, 3, 4, 5]. The RFC is\nessentially a three-phase motor and a single phase generator mounted on the same mechanical shaft.\nThe motor is either an asynchronous motor or a synchronous motor, depending on if the railway grid\nis synchronous to the public grid or asynchronous to the public grid. Therefore, two diﬀerent types of\nlow-frequency grids can be distinguished.\nIf the motor of the RFC is of synchronous type, the railway grid is synchronously coupled with\nthe public grid. This type of RFC are called synchronous-synchronous RFC. The pole ratio between\nthe synchronous motor and synchronous generator is 3 (Norway, Sweden) or 2.4 (U.S.). Therefore,\nthe induced frequency in the single-phase generator stator will be 16 2\n3 Hz in Norway and Sweden, and\n25 Hz in the U.S.",

Our\nDCOP-based reformulation of the dec-rtRTMP represents a\nproposal for an abstract mathematical framework to deal with\nsuch problem. However, translating this abstract framework\ninto concrete case studies can be challenging. Depending on\nthe application, one should carefully define some key aspects\nlike the concept of interaction between trains, the concept of\ncompatibility between paths of distinct trains and other oper-\national aspects. Nonetheless, recent work on railway traffic\nmanagement has demonstrated that similar approaches to de-\ncentralised railway traffic management are feasible[Mohanty\net al., 2020; D’Amato et al., 2024], paving the way for new\ndevelopments in this field.\nBesides addressing the dec-rtRTMP, the proposed algo-\nrithm for DCOP could be applied to other application do-\nmains, related to traffic management or to other decentralised\ncoordination problems [Jing et al., 2020; Picard, 2022; Zil-\nberstein et al., 2025; Picard et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021].\nThe key feature of target problems are the decentralised\nchoice among a set of alternatives, respecting the compati-",

Con-\nsidering deformation during interventions can improve radiation\nexposure, reduce the need for contrast agents, and shorten pro-\ncedure time [50]. This could be implemented by including a\ndeformation model for the vessel mesh, allowing for vessel flex-\nibility, albeit with increased computational demands. Heartbeat\neffects could be simulated by applying a force field on the device\nthat exerts force in the direction of blood flow, while breathing\nmotion could be simulated by applying cyclic movement and\ndeformation patterns to the vessel system.\n7 C onclusion\nThis work introduces the simulation framework stEVE, tailored\nfor endovascular interventions with the primary purpose of\nstreamlining and supporting future research endeavors in the\nfield of robotic assistance systems in endovascular interventions.\nThe introduced benchmarks are designed to enhance the compa-\nrability of research in the domain of learning-based autonomous",

Consequently, track quality assessment has become a hot issue in transportation \nsafety re search. It is critical to developing early warning systems that minimize \ndisruptions to the transportation network. \nNowadays, high-speed lines mainly use ballastless tracks, so the rail mainly has \nshortwave diseases. Moreover, shortwave track diseases are generally manifested as \nlocal track irregularities.  Garg and Dukkipati [2] describe the various typically local \nirregularity expressions reported in field measurements. Such irregularity will cause an \nadditional impact force from the wheel-rail force and accelerate the deterioration of the \nrail. Worse, the additional impact force will be transmitted to the under -rail bridge \nstructure through th e bridge -rail interaction point, causing potential damage to the \nbridge structure. Therefore, shortwave track diseases must be detected and maintained \nas early as possible.  \nRegularly detecting the health status of the railway system through the track \ninspection car is the main traditional method[3-5].

Rather than train all components of our\nmodel in one stage, we use a two-stage approach as shown\nby Figure 1:\n• In the first stage, we first freeze the image patch encoder\nand the LM and only train the gated pooling attention and\nprojection layer. This forces the multi-view image em-\nbeddings to align with the type of embeddings the LM\nexpects.\n• Then in the last stage, we only keep the image patch en-\ncoder frozen and start to finetune the LM.",

Crop and Uncrop\nAs shown in Fig. 3, during the forward pass, most of the\nBEV feature map is empty. That is because narrow LiDAR\nslices do not take up much physical space. Similarly, when\none or two cameras are used (total FoV ∼125◦), most of\nthe 3D volumetric representation V is empty after projection.\nConvolutions on these empty regions wastes memory and\ncompute. To save these resources and to facilitate conver-\ngence, we propose dividing a single BEV feature map into\nfour quarters, discard the ones without a slice and stack the\nper-slice 1/4 feature maps to process them as a mini-batch.\nThe same cropping procedure is used with the volumetric\nrepresentation ( Vcr ∈R\nVx/2×Vy/2×Vz×c). This maintains the\nspatial correspondence between BEV feature maps from both\nmodalities. It also speeds up projection and 3D convolutions.\nTABLE I\nNUSCENES TEST SET : 3D DETECTION ACCURACY RESULTS\nModel Modality Stream mAP Car Ped Bicycle\nPointPillars [16] PC \u0017 30.5 68.4 59.7 1.1",

The authors in \n[16] proposed a transmission strategy against \nhigh-speed mobility in TDD MIMO systems. The \nresults show that the proposed scheme can efficiently \nreduce the effect of the CSI impairment at the \ntransmitter caused by channel variation.

With this,\nvery good segmentation results with a mean IoU of 71.48%\nof 9 classes are achieved.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In section II, we intro-\nduce related work and datasets.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION \nThe problem described in this paper is to associate the signals to the specific track they belong to. The \ninput is video feed from the front facing camera mounted on the locomotive. Since the images obtained \nfrom the video feed lack depth information, and no detection and ranging equipment like LIDAR, \nultrasonic device is available on locomotive, it is likely that the distant signals which are proximate to the \ncurrent track might be associated with the same. The placement of signal with respect to track is not \nfixed and can vary immensely depending on the type of signal and as the locomotive moves on the track \nas seen in Figure 2. \nAdditionally, due to space constraint and rail traffic densities in urban areas, multiple lines run in \nparallel.

APPROACH \n3.1 FIXED REGION OF INTEREST (ROI)  \nThe simplest approach to the problem can be to select a fixed region of interest based on heuristics and \nrun object detection algorithm on that. But it cannot take the spatial variation of signal placement into \nconsideration as the region is fixed. If a bigger region is taken considering all possible signal placements, \nmany signals of other track are detected, thus increasing the false positive rate.  \n3.2 FIXED ROI BASED ON RULES \nAnother intuitive approach is to keep checking on the left half of the image, if no signal is found check to \nthe right.

For most cases in\nprevious generations, satellite systems were considered completely independent from the\nterrestrial communication (Khalili et al., 2019). However, there exists a potential short-\ncoming that the satellite system will degenerate in the presence of shadowing, which oc-\ncurs when the line-of-sight (LOS) link between the satellite and the terrestrial user is blocked\nby obstacles (Ruan et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019).\nThe high-speed railway (HSR) is one of the most challenging scenarios in the ﬁfth-\ngeneration mobile communication system (5G) (Liu et al., 2019), whose demands for high\ndata rate transmission and high reliability services have grown rapidly (Huang et al., 2019).\nOn the one hand, the terrestrial cellular network can provide low cost coverage for high\nreliability applications in HSR environment through its non-LOS (NLOS) communica-",

On the other hand, the satellite system can mitigate the problems of overload and\ncongestion by providing wide coverage to complement and extend the dense terrestrial\ncells, especially for the terrestrial wireless communication in HSR areas. Thus, it can be\nseen that a/an hybrid/integrated satellite-terrestrial cooperative communication system\ncan realize genuine ubiquitous coverage for future HSR communications (Arapoglou et\nal., 2011; Choi & Joo, 2015). In this case, the terrestrial mobile users can make full use\nof the spatial diversity gain by receiving independent multipath fading signals from satel-\nlites and terrestrial base stations. Consequently, the eﬀectiveness and reliability of trans-\nmission will be greatly increased (Paillassa et al., 2011).\nIn order to realize this vision, the integrated satellite-terrestrial communication sys-\ntems should be carefully designed, especially by analyzing the interference between the\nsatellite link and the terrestrial link based on realistic channel characteristics (Ji et al.,",

Moreover, compared with the TrUE, the quite narrow antenna beamwidth\nof the SaUE will cause more situations of the direct path obstructed by the pylons (see\nFig. 5), and further lead to a series of deep fading at 150, 250, 350 and 450 m in Fig.\n4(a) and Fig. 4(c).\nFurthermore, the received power of terrestrial links (i.e., BS2TrUE and BS2SaUE)\ndecreases as the train gradually moves away from the base station. This is not only due\nto the increase of the free space path loss caused by the increasing propagation distance,\nbut also because that the direct path is not aligned with the main lobe of the Rx antenna\nin the elevation plane, which results in relatively low power of the direct path. This an-\ntenna misalignment is depicted in Fig. 6. Despite the fact that in terrestrial links, the\nLOS component is also obstructed when the train is running under the crossing bridges\nand pylons, it is not as pronounced as in satellite-terrestrial links, because of the reduced\nincidence elevation angle and the rich multipath components caused by the surround-\ning objects.",

Accordingly, the rainfall has a greater impact on the received sig-\nnal from satellite antennas, compared with the received signal from terrestrial BSs.\nThus for the terrestrial HSR system, the attenuation of the interference signal caused\nby rainfall is greater than that of the useful signal, which leads to higher SIR values in\nthe rainy day. While as for the satellite-terrestrial system, the attenuation of the use-\nful signal caused by rainfall is greater than that of the interference signal, which results\nin lower SIR values in the rainy day.

This directive aims to facilitate\nthe adoption of the Community railways to the Single Market and to increase their\nefficiency. To do that, it is intended to separate the infrastructure management from\nthe provision of transport services and ensure access to the networks of the Member\nStates for Railway Undertakings. The European so-called 4th railway package (EU\nRegulation 2016/2338) aims to remove the remaining barriers to the creation of a\nsingle European rail area. Additionally, the updated legislation includes the proposal\nto open up domestic passenger railways to new entrants and services from December\n2019. This way, Railway Undertakings will be able either to offer competing services,\nsuch as a new train service on a particular route, or to bid for public service rail\ncontracts through tendering.\nThe objectives of competition in the railway industry encompass several key aspects,\nincluding fare reduction (Vigren (2017)), enhanced service frequencies (as discussed in",

The former\nrepresents a single operator (the so-called incumbent operatoror national railway un-\ndertaking) that operates in a monopoly situation and assumes a captive demand, which\nwas customary in the member states of the European Union. The latter, also known\nas open passenger railway market, new railway operators (the so-called entrants) com-\npete with each other for the time slot to which rail services are allocated. However, the\nexpected transition from a vertical to a horizontal market has been very difficult (Nash\n(2008), Cantos-S´ anchez, Pastor Mons´ alvez, and Serrano-Mart´ ınez (2021)).

The IM has a central role in the whole system, as their\ndecisions to allocate time slots to different RUs may affect the equilibrium of the\nsystem and even lead to a monopoly situation. It is a critical process in order to\nguarantee fair competition between the RUs, since an unfair allocation or one that\nbenefits the incumbent operator may affect the profitability and performance of the\nother RUs and the whole system (Broman and Eliasson (2019)).\nIn this context, there is a need to design optimal decision-making procedures in\nopen passenger railway markets which guarantee equal treatment for all RUs involved\nin order to improve the socially efficient use of the railway system. It motivates the\npurpose of this paper: study how the decisions made by the IM when allocating time\nslots have an impact on the equilibrium state and determine the benefit of RUs.\nTime slot allocation can be addressed using different approaches (Broman, Eliasson,\nand Aronsson (2022)): to carry it out, the IM can use an auction-based criterion or",

For this purpose, TSA-OPEN problem is considered within an equilibrium\nmodel. Thus, for each of the RUs in the market, we obtain what their bid for operat-\ning rights in the time slots will be. This bid is so-called “strategy” and can be made\nup, in turn, of different requests or bids that the company can make with a given\nprobability.

It can be broadly defined as follows: given a set of RUs, a set of\ntime slots, the capacities of each RUs to operate them and the bids of the different RUs\nto operate the time slot, the result of TSA-OPEN will be an allocation of the time slot\nto the different RUs. According to Broman, Eliasson, and Aronsson (2022), fairness is\none of the most important features that a TSA-OPEN method must meet. It is the\ntask of IM to allocate time slots to different RUs taking into account the capacities\nof each one and solving the conflicts between them. A conflict or conflict state occurs\nwhen two or more RUs apply for access to the same track at the same time (Schlechte\n(2012)).

Some recent incidents have shown that possibly the vulnerability of IT sys-\ntems in railway automation has been underestimated. Fortunately, so far, almost only\ndenial-of-service attacks were successful, but due to several trends, such as the use of\ncommercial IT and communication systems or privatization, the threat potential could\nincrease in the near future. However, up to now, no harmonized IT security risk as-\nsessment framework for railway automation exists. This paper defines an IT security\nrisk assessment framework which aims to separate IT security and safety requirements\nas well as certification processes as far as possible. It builds on the well-known safety\nand approval processes from IEC 62425 and integrates IT security requirements based\non the ISA99/IEC62443 standard series. While the detailed results are related to rail-\nway automation the general concepts are also applicable to other safety-critical appli-\ncation areas.\nKeywords.

For example, it was reported that, on December 1, 2011, “hack-\ners, possibly from abroad, executed an attack on a Northwest rail company's computers that\ndisrupted railway signals for two days” [1]. Although the details of the attack and also its\nconsequences remain unclear, this episode clearly shows the threats to which railways are\nexposed when they rely on modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) communication and\ncomputing technology. However, in most cases, the attacks are denial-of-service attacks\nleading to service interruptions, but so far not to safety-critical incidents. But also other\nservices, such as satellite positioning systems, have been shown to be susceptible to IT\nsecurity attacks, leading to a recommendation that GNSS services should not be used as\nstandalone positioning services for safety-related applications [2].\nWhat distinguishes railway systems from many other systems is their inherently distrib-",

The first version of the standard was elaborated in 2001. It has proven\nquite successful and is also used in other application areas, e.g. industry automation. This\nstandard defines threats and countermeasures to ensure safe communication in railway sys-\ntems. So, at an early stage, the standard established methods to build a safe channel (in\nsecurity, called “tunnel” or “conduit”) through an unsafe environment. However, the threats\nconsidered in IEC 62280 arise from technical sources or the environment rather than from\nhumans.

Nevertheless, IEC 62425 provides a structure for a safety case which\nexplicitly includes a subsection on protection against unauthorized access (both physical\nand informational).\nOn the other hand, industrial standards on information security exist.

What’s called a hazard in safety is called a threat\nin IT security, but the risk analysis processes really look alike. Thus it would be a logic\nconclusion to apply the same risk assessment techniques to IT security.

As a matter of fact this similarity is used in many security standards, ISO\n27005 [12] being the most general, but instead of probability the term likelihood is intro-\nduced.

The likelihood risk factor combines an esti-\nmate of the likelihood that the threat event will be initiated with an estimate of the likeli-\nhood of impact (i.e., the likelihood that the threat event results in adverse impacts).

The concept aims at the separation of safety and security aspects, as far as\npossible. This is achieved by integrating safety-related security requirements into the safety\nprocess and the safety case.\nIt has been explained that this approach matches well with the planned ISA99/IEC62443\nseries of standards, but that some aspects such as SL allocation need to be adapted. If this\nadaptation were successful, then railway automation could re-use the ISA99/IEC62443\nseries, in particular their standardized IT security requirements, and would not have to cre-\nate its own IT security standards.

In all of these lines of\nresearch, the overall objective is to minimize energy use, or\nwork done by the train, rather than the cost of the electricity\nto the infrastructure manager, an important component of our\nproposed scheme.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section\nII describes the problem faced by the railway and train\noperators in scheduling DERs and trains along the railway\nsystem. In Section III we break out the railway dispatch,\ni.e. dispatch of the generators and other assets along the\nrailway track based on the estimated renewable generation,\ntraction electric demand and electric and thermal loads for",

In some systems, the track and electric system\nthat powers the trains are owned by an entity that charges a\nfee for the utilization of their facilities. This entity is typically\nresponsible for the maintenance of the track, procuring the\nelectric power to feed the trains, dispatching rail-side DERs\nand controlling trafﬁc along the system. These entities are\ncommonly known as Railway Operators. We will denote\nTrain Operators as those who are in charge of the use of\nthe track based on their projected train schedules, maintain\nand dispatch the trains and pay usage fees to the Railway\nOperator. The problem that we consider in this paper is a\ncombined optimization of both the railway dispatch and the\ntrain dispatch, with Railway Operator and Train Operator",

Knowledge Transfer\nWe investigate the beneﬁts of policy re-use for sharing\nknowledge between different driving tasks. By sharing\nknowledge from different tasks we can reduce learning\ntime and create more general and capable systems. Ideally\nknowledge sharing can be extended to involve a system that\ncontinues to learn after it has been deployed (Thrun, 1996)\nand can enable a system to accurately predict appropriate\nbehavior in novel situations (Isele et al., 2016). We exam-\nine the behavior of various knowledge sharing strategies in\nthe autonomous driving domain.\n4.1. Direct Copy\nDirectly copying a policy indicates the differences between\ntasks. To demonstrate how well a network trained on one\ntask ﬁts another, we train a network on a single source task\nfor 25,000 iterations. The unmodiﬁed network is then eval-\nuated on every other task. We repeat this process, using\neach different task as a source task.\n4.2. Fine-Tuning\nFine-tuning allows a network to adapt from the source to\nthe target task.

Our initial approach incorporated a “distribution” fa ctor into the deﬁnition, as follows:\nTc,IQR = 1\nN\nM\n/summation.disp\nm= 1\nNmFm(1 −IQR), (1)\nwhere we augment the original formula with the interquartile range ( IQR) of total nodes’ ﬂow (within each Module)\ndistribution. The interquartile range is deﬁned as the diﬀerence bet ween the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data.\nBy including the factor (1 − IQR), we ensure that when ﬂow variability is minimal (i.e., IQR is close to zero),\nits contribution to the overall index becomes negligible. Figure S 1 shows the distribution of IQR values of nodes’\nﬂow within Modules for both Scenarios R24 and R33, revealing their ne gligible contribution.

Limitations for Target and Season\nThis study discovered the feasibility of unsupervised de-\nterioration detection highlighting wooden sleeper using the\ndeeper FCDDs in rural railway.

This region of\ntarget is smaller and closer, but the impact of defective sta-\ntus is larger to be potential accident of derailment. The key\nof data preparedness is to divide the cropped image with\nthe size of 1280 ×2560 into the left-side and right-side of\nrail with the size of 1280 ×1280, respectively. Though the\ndeterioration scope of wooden sleeper contains both side of\nrail, but the defective scope of fastener and spike must be\nrecognized as either left-side or right-side of rail. In addi-\ntion, the season of this study was at spring, April and May\n2023. Another season, especially winter may influence the\nbackground noise: larger shadow, decayed grass, iced, and\nsnowy. For more robustness, we can acquire video at var-\nious scene, and the prepared data enable to update the pa-\nrameters of our anomaly detector.\n4.3.

To\naddress the challenges of background noise and imbalanced\ndata, augmentation preprocessing such as mixup, and ran-\ndom erasing can be effective for one-class classification\nmodels. However, the imbalance issue remains for infre-\nquent defects such as spikes out of rail from wooden sleep-\ners, cracks of concrete sleepers, and holes on ballast tracks.\nTo overcome this challenge, the risk-weighted anomaly\nscore generated by our deeper FCDDs can be used in edge\ndevices for effective data acquisition of rare classes. By col-\nlecting only the frames that have hazard marks with signif-\nicantly higher anomaly scores than a predefined threshold,\nthe data acquisition process can be made more efficient. For\nrisk-based maintenance to incorporate the potential hazard\nof derailment in each track, we are able to add the label\nof curve ratio [11]. Then, we can utilize the risk-weighted\nanomaly score for supporting to make a decision of priority\nto repair effectively for sustainable and safety operation in\nrural railway.
